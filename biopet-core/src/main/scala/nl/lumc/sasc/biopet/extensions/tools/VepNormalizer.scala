  * This tool parses a VEP annotated VCF into a standard VCF file.
  * The VEP puts all its annotations for each variant in an CSQ string, where annotations per transcript are comma-separated
  * Annotations are then furthermore pipe-separated.
  * This tool has two modes:
  * 1) explode - explodes all transcripts such that each is on a unique line
  * 2) standard - parse as a standard VCF, where multiple transcripts occur in the same line
  * Created by ahbbollen on 10/27/14.
